    <p>To Be Alive</p>

    <p>Sleep was all knew once the one I loved the most <span id = "departed"> _________</span> from me. The only <span id = "peace">_______</span> I found was nestled between a cold pillow and a woolen blanket. One day this town recieved more of God's tears than often, the drains could work quick enough so the town became a 2ft pool. With nothing else to do, I crawled back to the oly happiness I've known for the past three months.</p>
    <p>
        <button type ="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('departed').innerHTML = firstVariableValue">departed</button>

        <button type ="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('peace').innerHTML = secondVariableValue">peace</button> <br>
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I fell asleep quicker than usual, and I entered a dream. I have not dreamed since I was a pitcher for the towns little league baseball team. This dream was intriguing, it was a tall, stunning goddess telling me to go experience laughter, freedom, and forgiveness or else my only happiness would be taken. Three days has went by and I ignored the goddess wishes. I noticed I have not been able to rest since. </p> <br>
    <p><span id = "Desperate">_________</span> to get my rest back, I decided to attempt to follow the goddess commands. As silly as I felt, I decided to buy tickets to the new comedy movie. To my suprise, I was able to laugh again. It felt good, it did not feel foreign. I looked over at my peers and they were heckling as well. It felt rejuvenating to be around so many happy souls. As days went by, rest came and went. So I decided to go sky diving. I have always been afraid of skydiving, but it is an item on my bucket list. The day finally came to skydive and the minute I fell from the plane, I felt a rush a freedom. I felt alive, I felt grateful; at that moment I forgot all about the goddess and her commands. This is something I wanted to do on my own.</p>
    <p>
        <button type ="button"
            onclick="document.getElementById('Desperate').innerHTML = thirdVariableValue">Desperate</button> <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My rest has been back consistently for about two months, <span id = "happier">__________</span> have never been happier. I continued to do things that makes laugh and feel free. That goddess appearing in my dreams was the best thing that happened to me. While her last command was for me to forgive, I did not have to do anything to achieve forgiveness. In my heart I forgive you, and I hope this letter reaches you well and teaches you the three virtues to be alive. </p>
