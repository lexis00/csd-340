    <h2>Allow Me To Introduce Myself</h2>
    <p class = "intro"> Hi, thanks for stopping by. Im Alexis, and education has always been very important to me; therefore I am very excited to be apart of this course. Allow me to tell you a bit about me.</p> <br>
    <p><span class = "sentence"> I was born and raised and Florida.</span> Growing up, every hobby I picked up on involved adventure has always been integrated in each hobby. Fast forward a few years, I joined the Air Force for adventure and to consistently learn. During my time in the Air Force I had the luxury of creating significant bonds with those who served alongside me. 
    </p> <br>
    <p>Although adventure has always been apart of me, my time in the service made me into a hard worker and an avid learner. My love for knowledge has always been instilled in me, it just took a few years for it to present itself. As my mother always said "Knowledge comes in many different forms." </p>
